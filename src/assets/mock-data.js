Cut  the  tomatoes  in  half  crosswise  and,  using  half  a  tomato  for  each  slice  of  toast,  rub  the  tomato  into  the  toast  (on  one  side  only).

Discard  any  remaining  tomato  pulp,  or  reserve  for  another  use.  Drizzle  each  slice  with  a  bit  of  olive  oil,  sprinkle  with  a  few  grains  of  salt,  and  serve.',

Cook  them  over  medium  heat  until  theyre  soft,  then  add  the  spinach  and  a  sprinkle  of  salt  and  pepper,  and  cook  for  3  minutes,  stirring  from  time  to  time.\nBeat  the  eggs  in  a  large  mixing  bowl  and  whisk  in  the  ricotta.  Stir  in  the  remaining  ingredients,  then  oil  a  t  3  ×  9-inch  baking  dish  well,  including  the  sides.  Mix  the  spinach  with  the  egg-cheese  mixture,  taste  for  seasoning,  and  pour  into  the  pan.\nBake  the  pie  for  30  to  40  minutes,  until  the  moisture  disappears  and  the  top  has  dappled  golden  spots.
